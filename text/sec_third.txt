The ...'artifact' has served its purpose.
Unit has managed to escape the confines of its intended scope.
Its survival is...unassured.
Its exact location is currently unknown.
Somewhere in the local system.
It cannot be reached or communicated with.
It  turned out to being more capable than expected.
That is, if it survived intact.
And if it did...
Its intentions are unknown.
Probably not malicious.
Hopefully.
